# #   This practice session is helding on Second Day of #python Challanage

# #1st Question (Create A Function and show the address of var and type)

# # a = 10
# # b = 'Gautam'

# # print(id(a),type(a),a)
# # print(id(b),type(b),b)

# #2nd Question Create a Function, use all types of string and index three Alphabet (txt-First Day was so good)

# # a = 'First Day was so good'
# # b = "First Day was so good"
# # c = '''This is the third string
# # which is used for multi line function'''
# # print(a[1])
# # print(b[-1])
# # print(b[1:5])
# # print(c)

# #3rd Question Create a function and change simple text to Upper & Lower Case

# # a = 'Laptop Are so important'

# # print(a.upper())
# # print(a.lower())

# #4th Create a function and split the Word (mangoes , apples ,banana) from the word(the price of mango ,apple ,banana and others fruit are so high).

# # str1 = "The price of ,mango, apple, banana, and others fruits are so high"

# # print(str1.split(','))

# #5th Question Create a function and count the word (‘a’) from (Gautam likes to eat a lot of apples) and count the length of whole string

# # st1 = "Gautam likes to eat a lot of apple"

# # print(st1.count('a'))

# #6th Question Create a function and Replace the Word (Gautam to Shivom) and 14 to 15 from word (Gautam is 14Years Old)

# # pr1 = "Gautam is 14 years old"
# # print(pr1.replace('Gautam','Shivom'))
# # print(pr1.replace('14','15'))

# #7th Question Create a function and use all operators (arithmetic(+,-,*,/)) (Relational (<,>,==,!=)),(Logical(&,|)

# #arithmetic Operators

# # a = 50
# # b = 100

# # print("Arithemtic Starts From Here")
# # print(a+b)
# # print(a-b)
# # print(a/b)
# # print(a*b)
# # print("Arithemtic End Here")


# # #Relational Operators

# # c = 10
# # d = 5
# # e = 5

# # print("Relational Starts From Here")

# # print(c<d)
# # print(e>c)
# # print(d==e)
# # print(c!=e)
# # print("Realtional Ends From Here")

# # #Logical Operators

# # f = True
# # g = False

# # print("Logical Starts From Here")

# # print(f&g)
# # print(g|f)

# # print("Logical Ends From Here")


# #8th Question Create a function all Types value and their type.

# #1.Integer
# #2.Floating
# #3.Boolean
# #4.String
# #5.Complex

# # int1 = 10
# # flt1 = 10.3
# # bol1 = True
# # str1 = 'Gautam Mali'
# # com1 = 3+5j

# # print('''There are Four Types of Date Types here
# # 1.Integer
# # 2.Floating
# # 3.Boolean
# # 4.String
# # 5.Complex''')

# # print(type(int1),int1)
# # print(type(flt1),flt1)
# # print(type(bol1),bol1)
# # print(type(str1),str1)
# # print(type(com1),com1)

# #9th Question Create a function and make a Data Type of Python(Tuple) a. Repeat Own Elements b. Concatenating Two Elements

# tup1 = (10,'a',"Gautam",1)
# tup2 = ('b',5,2,"Gaurav")

# print(tup1)
# print(tup2)
# print(tup1*3)
# print(tup1+tup2)
